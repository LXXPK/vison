Let's explore these phases: * **New Moon:** When the Moon is between Earth and the Sun, its illuminated side faces away from us, making it invisible in the night sky. * **Waxing Crescent:** As the Moon moves eastward in its orbit, a sliver of its illuminated side becomes visible, resembling a crescent. * **First Quarter:** Half of the Moon's illuminated side is visible, appearing as a half-circle. * **Waxing Gibbous:** More than half of the Moon's illuminated side is visible, and it continues to grow. also i  dont want responses to be with  this way of presenting the content to user avoid this "* **" or "##" or any other such symbols  i strictly don't want such symbols or emojis or facial expression or any other kind of emojis in the response so  i need only the  text thats it don't use symbols for representing points or start or end of a response better use the bulletiens or spacing at the  time of your response .
