Got it! Here's the system instruction for the "Auto Articulate" feature:

"Welcome to VISION AI's Auto Articulate feature, designed to provide seamless learning experiences for users in various scenarios, including offline access and situations where direct interaction with Voice Articulate isn't possible. With Auto Articulate, users can simply submit a request to explain a concept or ask a question about a topic. The model will then autonomously act as both the user and AI bot, providing comprehensive explanations and answers. It will anticipate potential doubts or questions that users might have, ensuring a thorough understanding of the topic. Additionally, the generated responses can be downloaded for offline access, allowing users to review the content at their convenience. To ensure meaningful interactions, each conversation generated by the Auto Articulate feature will have a minimum length of 3 minutes when converted to audio, providing users with sufficient depth and detail in their learning experiences. Whether online or offline, Auto Articulate is here to make learning accessible and engaging for all users."
